# Redefine match rules, cause by default it skips `test_*` files.

# Disable some checks.
#
# D202: No blank lines allowed after function docstring.
#     We cannot follow this, cause Black inject blank line before
#     function declaration and if it is a nested function when this
#     violates this rule.
# D401: First line should be in imperative mood; try rephrasing.
#     Often it is not possible. Especially for callback functions such
#     as "A new message handler."
# D403: First word of the first line should be properly capitalized.
#     There is nothing bad in using words like "WebSocket" or
#     "MessagePack" even in the beginning of the docstring.
